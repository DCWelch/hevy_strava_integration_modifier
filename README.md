# Hevy Strava Integration Modifier
A tool that automatically removes Strava activity descriptions posted from Hevy.
This tool listens for new Strava activity events using a webhook and updates the description of workouts synced from Hevy with a custom message or format (the current implementation simply removes the description, but keeps the title and images).
